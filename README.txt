This is a "read me" file to explain calibration pulser data.  There were four different temperature runs:

Room temperature runs of all pulsers
	This is labeled "room_temp_runs"
	All runs were normal
	Pulser and noise completed
	All timing on scope: 1ns, 500ps, 250ps
	-18 dB for pulses, -20 dB for noise

-50 C runs for all pulsers
	Labeled "cold_minus50_runs"
	Also labeled "Cold50_Runs" for short
	416 looked strange - only appeared with 2 dB attenuation
	Duplicates of the 416 runs were made.  They are the same, just labeled differently.  I didn't want to forget that this was the run with 2 dB, but it also seemed too annoying to change my naming structure in my code.  I probably could have.  Or changed it here.  Sorry.

-28 C runs for all pulsers
	Labeled "cool_minus28_runs" or "Cool28_Runs"
	All normal.

Room temperature again (after the cold/cool runs)
	These are labeled "room_temp_runs_post_cold_runs"
	It's a long title.  Sorry.
	This also contains the .csv files, which have information about sampling intervals and timing stuff.  Hopefully it's helpful!
